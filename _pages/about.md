<p>Hello, I am P Manikandan Nair, a major in Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering program from VIT Chennai.</p>

<p>I like to write simple scripts that automate daily mundane tasks. I feel very passionate towards hardware. Just the simple sight of a PCB board with embedded components or a microcontroller gives me a sense of adrenaline rush.</p>

<p>I also try my best to contribute to open source projects and encourage their use whenever possible.</p>
