<pre>
In Savannah's heat where sunbeams dance
Nature's beauty captures all in trance
Flute of birds heard in gentle breeze
Everyone charmed by the manakin's eaze
                               
A story retold, a tale of bee and bloom
With soft petals and beautiful plume
Starting at dawn with petals' dew
The bee and bloom enjoyed life's hues

A blissful bond between them was cast
Secrets whispered from mysterious past
Hours went, they would laugh and play
Their sweet world in full display

One day, drops trickled down the sky
Everyone ran to shelter nearby
Very soon grey clouds overcast
Telling signs of a pending outcast?

Time flies and seasons change
Inseparable in the past, now estrange
Where buzz was once heard from noon to moon
Now all that echoed was crickets' tune

As autumn uncovers path with gilt
Winter approaches and leaves wilt
As every dawn sets a beautiful mist
Spring hopes for a future tryst
</pre>
